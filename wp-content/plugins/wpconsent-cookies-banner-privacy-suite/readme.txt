Improve WordPress privacy compliance. Custom GDPR / CCPA cookie consent banner, full site cookie scanner, automatic script blocking and cookie policy

== Description ==

= Customizable Cookie Banner + Website Compliance Scanner =

WPConsent is the easiest way to add a GDPR / CCPA cookie consent banner to your WordPress website. You can customize the banner to match your website's branding and configure how it looks.

Our easy-to-use website cookie scanner will automatically detect and list popular services used on your website. Our built-in integration provides you with details and a list of cookies used by each service, so you can easily configure them to comply with GDPR, CCPA / CPRA, ePrivacy, DSGVO, TTDSG, LGPD, POPIA, APA, RGPD, PIPEDA, and other global privacy regulations.

With the automatic script blocking feature, WPConsent will detect and block common tracking scripts / cookies like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and more until the user gives consent. This ensures that those services can't add 3rd party cookies without user consent as required by GDPR and other privacy regulations.

All cookie consent data is self-hosted on your website like it should be, making WPConsent the most privacy conscious solution.

= Fully Customizable Cookie Banner =

The cookie banner should match your website's branding and be easy to use. We give you many options in order to improve the consent rates on your website while being in full compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws:

* Choose from multiple banner layouts and positions.
* Customize all colors and text to match your website's branding.
* Add your logo for a professional look.
* Multiple button styles to choose from.

= Automatic Script Blocking =

WPConsent will automatically prevent many popular tracking scripts from adding cookies on your website to improve GDPR compliance. There's no need to change the tracking solutions you use in order to use WPConsent. We are continuously adding new scripts to our block list, if you have a specific script you'd like us to block, please [reach out](https://wpconsent.com/contact/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin).

Automatically detected scripts:

* Google Analytics
* Google Ads
* Facebook Pixel
* Microsoft Clarity
* Pinterest Tag
* and many more...

Google Consent Mode v2 is now supported, allowing you to use Google Analytics and Google Ads without cookies until the user gives consent. Our integration automatically works whether you add the scripts using [WPCode](https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers/), a plugin like [MonsterInsights](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/) or even if using Google Tag Manager.

= Website Compliance Scanner =

Our goal with WPConsent was to create a WordPress privacy compliance plugin that's both EASY and POWERFUL.

That's why we added a built-in website cookie scanner that detects many popular services used on your website.

But that's not all, with our API integration you can get details about services and cookies used by each service automatically configured on your site.

These are the details included with each service:

* Service Name
* Service Description
* Service Category
* Service Privacy/Data URL (if 3rd party)
* List of Cookies with description and duration

= Smart Content Blocking =

Prevent 3rd party content from being loaded before consent is given.

WPConsent can automatically block content like YouTube, Vimeo, DailyMotion, Google Maps, reCAPTCHA and more until the user gives consent.

Dynamic placeholders are displayed for YouTube, Vimeo and DailyMotion for a better user experience. The placeholder images are loaded from your website for improved privacy compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and more.

You can easily customize which content is blocked from the admin area.

= Supports Key Global Privacy Regulations =

The WPConsent plugin offers a high degree of flexibility, making it a valuable tool for addressing a wide array of cookie law, data protection, and privacy regulations. This includes, but is not limited to:

* GDPR: The General Data Protection Regulation, ePrivacy Directive, ePrivacy Regulation (European Union)
* CCPA: The California Consumer Privacy Act (California, United States)
* LGPD: The Brazilian General Data Protection Law (Brazil)
* AAP: Australia’s Privacy Principles (Australia)
* PECR: The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (UK)
* PIPEDA: The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (Canada)
* and many other international standards and laws.
